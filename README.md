# UFOs
## **Overview**
The purpose of the analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criterias of date, city, state, country and shape.

## **Results:** 
* The UFO sightings tables looks like below allowing the users to filter based on date, city, state, country and shape.

## **Summary:**

* One drawback of the design is that it doesnt capture the error and display a user friendly message if users inputs wrong data to be filtered.
* It also doesnt display the results if the user inputs data with a different case than lower case.
* The search criteria could be more precise with pictures of the sightings with other technical findings about the UFO sightings.
* It would be a great idea to add a feature to provide a comparison for any two or more UFO sightings to find similarities or differences.
